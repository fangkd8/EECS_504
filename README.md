The link for temporary datasets is: https://www.cityscapes-dataset.com/downloads/

For test, we are using 'gtFine_trainvaltest.zip (241MB) [md5]' as labels, and using 'leftImg8bit_trainvaltest.zip (11GB) [md5]' as raw input images for training.

When validating our training outcome, we are using the images of 'val' subfolder of the corresponding datasets.

To test our code, we are now using deducted train, label and val sets.
